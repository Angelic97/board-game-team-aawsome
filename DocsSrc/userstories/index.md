* As players we roll the dice, highest starts.
* Player 1 rolls the dice and receives 1 or 6 to enter the board.


* As a player I can choose to have two tokens on my starting square.
* As a player I cannot pass my own token, only the opponents.
* As a player I can have many tokens on the board but only move one per dice rolling.


* As a player if I get a 6 I can roll the dice again.
* As a player when my square is entered by antoher, my token goes back to the nest.
